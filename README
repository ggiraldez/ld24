PINCERS

A simple game made by Gustavo Giráldez for the Ludum Dare 24 compo (theme
Evolution) in August 26th, 2012.


Instructions

Use the mouse, arrow keys or WASD to guide your creature. Eat the red and blue
pills to regain life and energy. Attack other creatures to destroy them. Evolve
your creature by taking the remains of your enemy. Energy is currently unused
(didn't have time to add skills).

Press Escape to quit or restart the game. Press P to pause.


The game is programmed in Lua using the Löve game framework. Graphics were
drawn with the Gimp. The in-game font is Victor-Pixel grabbed from
http://www.dafont.com/victors-pixel-font.font. Sound effects were created with
sfxr from http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html.
